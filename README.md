## About

In theory, the application is based on the food needs of a regular house rabbit depending on its age! The owner of the rabbit can make an account of the rabbit and add a picture with it and information about it + the name of the rabbit's best friend (the person he lives with).
The principle of using the application is simple: you create an account to keep the data you enter about the rabbit, choose a nice picture, log in and you can create a menu from the list of foods he is allowed to eat or you can do a random menu. After choosing the menu for that day, the menu will be saved in 'previous menus' to monitor your pet's diet.
The application is being improved, at the moment having connected to the database only the login part.
It was used for its implementation of Room and Java.
